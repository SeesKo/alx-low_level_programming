## About this Project

- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- From the standard library, only the `printf` function is allowed. Any call to another function like `strdup`, `malloc`, â€¦ is forbidden.
- All header files should be include guarded.
